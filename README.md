SEO marketing (search engine optimisation) is an inbound digital marketing strategy that focuses on driving organic (unpaid) search traffic to your website by improving its visibility in the SERPs (search engine results pages). The best website builders come with built-in SEO features to make this process easier.

## What does SEO marketing do?
SEO marketing helps businesses to rank higher on search engines like Google for their target keywords—the words and phrases that their target customers type into search engines. This, in turn, can help drive more qualified traffic to your website and generate new leads for your business.

**There are several branches to SEO marketing, including:**

* **On-page SEO:** This involves optimising the content on your web pages around target keywords and relevant ranking factors. For example, it might entail ensuring that the content is formatted correctly, with suitable heading tags, alt text, and internal/external links.

* **Off-page SEO:** This involves actions taken outside of your website to improve your domain authority and organic ranking positions, such as backlink building and social media marketing.

* **Technical SEO:** This involves optimising your website’s backend to satisfy the technical requirements of search engines like Google. For example, it may involve taking steps to reduce page loading times by minifying code, or setting up redirects to conserve link equity.

* **Keyword research:** All good SEO marketing strategies start with careful keyword research. Keyword research involves finding viable high-volume queries that your target customers are searching for using tools like Google Adwords and then validating them.
